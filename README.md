# UBC Course Scheduler

This course scheduler will schedule UBC courses according to user preferences, 
using a rule-based scoring system to generate optimized schedules. Users will be 
able to view and select courses, read course descriptions, and set time 
preferences. The scheduler will visualize the result in a calendar.

Throughout my (very short) time at UBC, the most stressful
thing I have experienced so far is not a final or group presentation, but 
course registration. Watching the last spot in a lecture get taken while
waiting for your registration time to open and then having to redo half the schedule 
is not very fun. This is why I want to create a course scheduler which will not 
only reduce the stress and time of manually scheduling courses, but also 
optimize the courses, which would be difficult to do by hand.


## User Stories:

- As a user, I want to be able to browse available courses and their descriptions
- As a user, I want to be able to add courses to my schedule
- As a user, I want to be able to set schedule preferences such as:
    - choosing the earliest start time and latest end time
    - limiting the difference of total hours of class per day between each day
    - limiting the amount of spacing between individual courses
- As a user, I want to be able to choose how many schedules are displayed
- As a user, I want to be able to view the schedule 
- As a user, I want to be able to save my schedules and preferences to file (if I so choose)
- As a user, I want to be able to load my saved schedules and preferences from file (if I so choose)
- As a user, I want to be able to delete my saved schedules from file
- As a user, I want to be able to delete courses from the calendar preview
